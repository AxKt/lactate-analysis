# lactate-analysis
Analysing lactate tests is not a trivial task. Most of the time it is not very clear how the results ("thresholds") have been obtained and what the underlying model was. This project aims at providing open-source routines for exploring lactate-test time series.

Phenomenologic modeling (modeling the data rather
than the system) is appealing to physiologists beÂ¬
cause its meaning is readily understood.
